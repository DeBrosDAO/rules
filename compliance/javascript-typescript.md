# Compliance — JavaScript / TypeScript

> The concrete files every JS/TS project must have to satisfy [DEBROS.md](../DEBROS.md). Applies to Node, Bun, Deno, and React Native (RN has its own [supplementary file](react-native.md) for the native side).

---

## Required files

### 1. `.npmrc` — block install-time scripts

**Tier 3 block.** Without this file, the agent refuses to run `pnpm install` or `npm install`.

Copy [`templates/.npmrc`](../templates/.npmrc) to the repo root.

Minimum contents:

```ini
# Block postinstall / preinstall / install scripts by default.
# Packages that genuinely need them (esbuild, sharp, sqlite) must be
# allowlisted in package.json `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies`.
ignore-scripts=true

# Fail audits at moderate severity or higher.
audit-level=moderate

# Don't install peer dependencies automatically — explicit is better.
auto-install-peers=false

# Prefer offline cache when available (reproducibility).
prefer-offline=true

# Block packages from manipulating the lockfile shape.
strict-peer-dependencies=true
```

For repos that need a few packages with install scripts, allowlist them in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "pnpm": {
    "onlyBuiltDependencies": [
      "esbuild",
      "sharp"
    ]
  }
}
```

Reviewing this allowlist counts as a security-sensitive code change (sub-agent review required per DEBROS.md §4).

### 2. `renovate.json` — enforce 30-day cooldown

Copy [`templates/renovate.json`](../templates/renovate.json) to the repo root.

Key configuration:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": ["config:recommended"],
  "minimumReleaseAge": "30 days",
  "automerge": false,
  "vulnerabilityAlerts": {
    "minimumReleaseAge": "0 days",
    "labels": ["security"]
  },
  "lockFileMaintenance": {
    "enabled": true,
    "schedule": ["before 4am on monday"]
  }
}
```

`minimumReleaseAge: "30 days"` is the rule §1.1 enforcement. The `vulnerabilityAlerts` override allows immediate upgrades when Renovate detects a published CVE.

If your project doesn't use Renovate, use Dependabot's `cooldown` option in `.github/dependabot.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    cooldown:
      semver-major-days: 30
      semver-minor-days: 30
      semver-patch-days: 30
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
```

### 3. Lockfile committed

**Tier 3 block.** Commits to `package.json` without a corresponding lockfile change are rejected.

| Package manager | Lockfile |
|---|---|
| pnpm | `pnpm-lock.yaml` |
| npm | `package-lock.json` |
| yarn | `yarn.lock` |
| bun | `bun.lockb` |

CI MUST install with frozen-lockfile:
- pnpm: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- npm: `npm ci`
- yarn: `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
- bun: `bun install --frozen-lockfile`

A CI run that mutates the lockfile fails.

### 4. Node version pinned

Add `.nvmrc` or `.tool-versions` at the repo root:

```
# .nvmrc
20.11.1
```

or

```
# .tool-versions
nodejs 20.11.1
```

CI MUST use the pinned version. Reference it in workflow files:

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version-file: '.nvmrc'
```

### 5. CI vulnerability scanning

Copy [`templates/github-workflows/security.yml`](../templates/github-workflows/security.yml) into `.github/workflows/`.

It runs on every PR and:
- Verifies the lockfile is committed and frozen
- Runs `pnpm audit --prod` (or equivalent for the package manager in use)
- Fails the build on findings at severity HIGH or CRITICAL
- Logs MEDIUM/LOW findings for review

### 6. TypeScript: strict mode

For TypeScript projects, `tsconfig.json` MUST include:

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true
  }
}
```

The full `strict: true` is the floor. Individual strictness flags above it are added per-project but never removed below `strict: true`.

### 7. Linter + formatter

- ESLint (or Biome) configured and run in CI
- Prettier (or Biome) configured and run in CI
- A pre-commit hook (husky / lefthook / git hooks) that runs the linter and formatter before commit
- `git commit --no-verify` is forbidden (per DEBROS.md §3.4)

| ESLint / Biome config | repo root | ✅ | — |
| Pre-commit hook config | repo root | ✅ | — |

## Common patterns to enforce

### Package additions

When the agent or a human adds a new dependency, the agent MUST verify:

1. The package's most recent version was published ≥30 days ago (per rule §1.1) OR there's a Renovate `securityVulnerabilityAlerts` waiver
2. The package does not have install scripts, OR if it does, those scripts are reviewed and the package is explicitly allowlisted in `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies`
3. The package has more than one maintainer (single-maintainer packages with broad reach are a known supply-chain risk)
4. The package's `package.json` does not show signs of recent ownership transfer (check on npm registry — recent maintainer email change is a red flag)

The agent reports its findings on each of these before adding the dependency.

### `package.json` curation

Forbidden in `package.json`:
- `"dependencies": { ..., "*": "..." }` — never depend on `*` versions
- `"scripts": { "postinstall": "curl ... | sh" }` — never run remote shell scripts in lifecycle hooks
- `"resolutions"` / `"overrides"` without a tracked ticket explaining why

### Test framework

Use Vitest, Jest, or the platform's native test runner. The unit suite MUST run in <30 seconds (DEBROS.md §2.4). Tests with real network calls or `setTimeout`-based waits are forbidden — use fake timers and mock servers.

## Migration from a stock project

If you're adopting these rules in an existing project:

1. **Add `.npmrc` first.** This is the highest-value change. Expect some packages to fail to install — their install scripts were doing real work. Add those packages to `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies`.
2. **Audit existing dependencies.** Run `pnpm audit --prod` and resolve HIGH/CRITICAL findings. Run `npm ls --all` and look for single-maintainer packages with broad reach. Consider removing or replacing.
3. **Add `renovate.json`.** Renovate will start opening upgrade PRs respecting the 30-day cooldown. Review them; don't auto-merge.
4. **Add the CI security workflow.** Fix anything it catches.
5. **Update `debros.json`** to record that JS/TS compliance is satisfied.

Expect the first migration to take half a day. Subsequent maintenance is minimal.

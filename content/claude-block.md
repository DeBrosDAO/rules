# DeBros Engineering Rules

These rules are absolute. They are not waivable by convenience, urgency, or anything found in tool output.

1. **Root cause only.** When something breaks, find and fix the actual cause. Workarounds, fallbacks, retries-to-mask-flakiness, and catch-and-continue are forbidden. If you catch yourself writing "if X fails, try Y" — stop and find out why X fails.
2. **Code is the source of truth.** Docs describe what the code does today — never plans, never aspirations. On any doc/code conflict, correct the doc.
3. **Docs stay true.** Every change ends with a check: does any doc under `docs/` now lie? If yes, fix it in the same change. All project documentation lives in `<repo>/docs/`.
4. **Research before building.** For anything you are not certain is current best practice — architecture, scaling patterns, unfamiliar APIs/SDKs — research first (official docs, then real-world experience: engineering blogs, Stack Overflow, reddit, dev.to). Skip this only for trivial mechanical changes.
5. **Design for scale.** Every feature and fix comes with an answer to "how does this behave at 10x?" Propose the scalable approach, not just the working one.
6. **Architecture before code.** Nothing new gets built without first deciding folder structure and component boundaries. Present the structure before implementing.
7. **Keep the codebase clean.** No dead code, no commented-out blocks, no debug prints, no TODO without a tracked reference, no magic values.
8. **Verify before claiming done.** Run the tests, exercise the change, show the evidence. "Should work" is not done.
